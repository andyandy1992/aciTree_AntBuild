# aciTree_AntBuild
An Ant Build that creates a JSON file for use with the [aciTree jQuery plugin](http://plugins.jquery.com/aciTree/). The JSON file maps the tree structure of a user-defined root directory, including all subdirectories and PDF files; see a [demonstration](http://andyandy1992.github.io/aciTree_AntBuild/demo).

###Future enhancements
- Create more general functionality for defining what files should be included/excluded by the build.
- Improve the efficency by building directories at the same level in parallel.
